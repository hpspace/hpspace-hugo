description: The team is tasked with helping NASA find whatever alerted a possible system failure on their JC-49 top-secret rocket that is set to launch from an Air Force base. To their surprise, former Homeland Security director Merrick, who is now working for NASA, asked for Scorpion personally and begrudgingly works with them. However, the mission is threatened when Walter's date from the previous night, Linda, walks into the garage, handing him a jump drive with a recording of a scrambled voice giving them instructions to sabotage the launch or face the consequences of the bomb strapped to her chest. Meanwhile, Sylvester decides to audition for Jeopardy! in order to win enough money to buy the naming rights for the new pediatric wing at Megan's hospital so that it can be named after her, but he is nervous to be in front of the cameras.
